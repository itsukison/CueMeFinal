🎯 Expected Issues & Solutions
Based on the build.sh you showed, here's what's likely happening:
Issue: Binary Output Location
Your build.sh creates: custom-audiotee/build/audiotee
But needs to be: custom-binaries/audiotee
Fix: Update the end of custom-audiotee/build.sh:
bash# ... (keep all existing code until the end) ...

# Display binary info
echo ""
echo "📊 Binary information:"
echo "   Size: $(ls -lh "$OUTPUT_DIR/audiotee" | awk '{print $5}')"
echo "   Path: $OUTPUT_DIR/audiotee"
echo "   Architectures:"
lipo -info "$OUTPUT_DIR/audiotee"

# Test execution
echo ""
echo "🧪 Testing binary execution..."
if "$OUTPUT_DIR/audiotee" --help > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo -e "${GREEN}✅ Binary executes successfully${NC}"
else
    echo -e "${YELLOW}⚠️  Binary execution test inconclusive (may be normal for CLI tools)${NC}"
fi

# ✨ NEW: Copy to project's custom-binaries directory
PARENT_DIR="$(dirname "$SCRIPT_DIR")"
CUSTOM_BIN_DIR="$PARENT_DIR/custom-binaries"

echo ""
echo "📦 Copying binary to project location..."
mkdir -p "$CUSTOM_BIN_DIR"
cp "$OUTPUT_DIR/audiotee" "$CUSTOM_BIN_DIR/audiotee"
chmod +x "$CUSTOM_BIN_DIR/audiotee"

if [ -f "$CUSTOM_BIN_DIR/audiotee" ]; then
    echo -e "${GREEN}✅ Binary copied to: $CUSTOM_BIN_DIR/audiotee${NC}"
    
    # Verify the copied binary
    if otool -l "$CUSTOM_BIN_DIR/audiotee" | grep -q "__info_plist"; then
        echo -e "${GREEN}✅ Verified: Info.plist embedded in final binary${NC}"
    else
        echo -e "${RED}❌ ERROR: Info.plist not in final binary!${NC}"
        exit 1
    fi
else
    echo -e "${RED}❌ ERROR: Failed to copy binary!${NC}"
    exit 1
fi

echo ""
echo -e "${GREEN}✨ Build complete!${NC}"
echo -e "${GREEN}✅ Binary ready at: $CUSTOM_BIN_DIR/audiotee${NC}"

📝 Create scripts/build-native-binary.sh
Create this wrapper script:
bash#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "🚀 Starting native binary build process..."

# Get project root
PROJECT_ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/.." && pwd)"
echo "📁 Project root: $PROJECT_ROOT"

# Check if custom-audiotee directory exists
if [ ! -d "$PROJECT_ROOT/custom-audiotee" ]; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: custom-audiotee directory not found!"
    echo "Please ensure the audiotee source code is in: $PROJECT_ROOT/custom-audiotee"
    exit 1
fi

# Check if build script exists
if [ ! -f "$PROJECT_ROOT/custom-audiotee/build.sh" ]; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: build.sh not found in custom-audiotee/"
    exit 1
fi

# Check if Swift source exists
if [ ! -f "$PROJECT_ROOT/custom-audiotee/Sources/main.swift" ]; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: Swift source code not found!"
    echo "Missing: $PROJECT_ROOT/custom-audiotee/Sources/main.swift"
    echo ""
    echo "Please copy the source from audioteejs:"
    echo "  cd $PROJECT_ROOT/custom-audiotee"
    echo "  curl -L https://github.com/makeusabrew/audioteejs/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz | tar xz --strip-components=1"
    exit 1
fi

# Run the build
echo "🔨 Running build script..."
cd "$PROJECT_ROOT/custom-audiotee"
bash build.sh

# Verify output
if [ ! -f "$PROJECT_ROOT/custom-binaries/audiotee" ]; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: Build completed but binary not found in custom-binaries/"
    echo "Expected: $PROJECT_ROOT/custom-binaries/audiotee"
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Native binary build successful!"
ls -lh "$PROJECT_ROOT/custom-binaries/audiotee"
Make it executable:
bashchmod +x scripts/build-native-binary.sh
```

## 🧪 **Verification Steps**

### **Step 1: Check Your Structure**

Your project should look like this:
```
CueMeFinal/
├── custom-audiotee/           ← audiotee source
│   ├── Package.swift          ← With linker settings
│   ├── Info.plist             ← With NSAudioCaptureUsageDescription
│   ├── Sources/
│   │   └── main.swift         ← Swift source from audioteejs
│   ├── build.sh               ← Build script (updated)
│   └── build/                 ← Temp build output
│       └── audiotee           
├── custom-binaries/           ← Final binary location
│   └── audiotee               ← Gets copied here by build.sh
├── scripts/
│   ├── build-native-binary.sh ← Wrapper script
│   └── afterPack.js
└── package.json
Step 2: Test the Build
bash# Clean everything
rm -rf custom-binaries/ custom-audiotee/build/

# Run the build
npm run build:native

# Check output
ls -lh custom-binaries/audiotee

# Verify Info.plist
otool -l custom-binaries/audiotee | grep __info_plist
# Should output: sectname __info_plist

# Verify it runs
./custom-binaries/audiotee --help
Step 3: Test Full Production Build
bash# Full build
npm run build

# Build the app
npm run app:build:mac

# Verify binary in app
ls -lh "release/mac-arm64/CueMe.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar.unpacked/custom-binaries/audiotee"

# Check Info.plist in packaged app
otool -l "release/mac-arm64/CueMe.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar.unpacked/custom-binaries/audiotee" | grep __info_plist

🚨 If Swift Source is Missing
If you don't have custom-audiotee/Sources/main.swift, get it from the audioteejs repo:
bashcd custom-audiotee

# Download and extract audioteejs source
curl -L https://github.com/makeusabrew/audioteejs/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz -o audiotee.tar.gz
tar xzf audiotee.tar.gz --strip-components=1
rm audiotee.tar.gz

# Verify
ls -la Sources/main.swift

❓ Next Steps

Output of these commands:

bash   ls -la custom-audiotee/Sources/
   ls -la custom-binaries/
   npm run build:native
