```

### **3. Verify GitHub Actions Build**

---

## üß™ **Post-Release Testing**

### **Download & Install**

- [ ] Download v1.0.100 from GitHub releases
- [ ] Install to `/Applications/`
- [ ] Verify app launches without crashes

### **Entitlements Check**

```bash
# Verify helper app exists
ls -la /Applications/CueMe.app/Contents/Resources/Library/LoginItems/AudioTeeHelper.app

# Check entitlements
codesign -d --entitlements - /Applications/CueMe.app/Contents/Resources/Library/LoginItems/AudioTeeHelper.app 2>&1 | grep -E "screen-capture|app-sandbox"

# Should show:
# com.apple.security.device.screen-capture [Bool] true
# com.apple.security.app-sandbox [Bool] false
```

### **Permission Grant**

- [ ] Open System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen Recording
- [ ] Add AudioTeeHelper.app manually (if not auto-prompted)
  - Path: `/Applications/CueMe.app/Contents/Resources/Library/LoginItems/`
- [ ] Enable checkbox for AudioTeeHelper
- [ ] Restart CueMe

### **System Audio Test**

- [ ] Launch CueMe
- [ ] Enable system audio capture
- [ ] Play audio in another app
- [ ] Verify audio is captured (NOT all zeros)
- [ ] Check Console.app logs for errors
- [ ] Verify NO `0x6E6F7065` error

### **Expected Logs**

```
‚úÖ Found AudioTeeHelper
‚úÖ Using AudioTeeHelper.app - proper macOS helper application!
‚úÖ AudioTee capture started
üéµ FIRST audio chunk from audiotee (RAW BUFFER ANALYSIS)
   isAllZeros: false  ‚Üê MUST be false!
   rms: [non-zero value]
   normalizedRMS: [non-zero value]
```

## üìù **Release Notes Template**

```markdown
# v1.0.100 - Critical System Audio Fix

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### System Audio Capture Now Works!

Fixed critical issue where system audio capture was producing silent/zero audio buffers in production builds.

**Root Cause**: The AudioTeeHelper app was missing the `com.apple.security.device.screen-capture` entitlement due to electron-builder re-signing the helper with default entitlements.

**Fix**:

- Helper app now uses deep code signing to prevent re-signing
- Build process validates entitlements are correct
- Updated afterPack hook to verify (not modify) helper app

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

Users upgrading from v1.0.99 or earlier will need to:

1. Grant Screen Recording permission to "AudioTeeHelper" in System Settings
2. Restart CueMe after granting permission

## üìã How to Grant Permission

1. Open **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Screen Recording**
2. Click the **+** button
3. Press **Cmd+Shift+G** and paste:
```

/Applications/CueMe.app/Contents/Resources/Library/LoginItems/

```
4. Select **AudioTeeHelper.app** and click **Open**
5. Enable the checkbox
6. Restart CueMe

## ‚úÖ Verification

After granting permission, system audio capture will work correctly. You can verify by:
- Enabling system audio in CueMe settings
- Playing audio in another application
- Checking that CueMe captures the audio (visible in console logs)

## üîß Technical Details

The helper app now includes the following critical entitlements:
- `com.apple.security.device.screen-capture` = true
- `com.apple.security.app-sandbox` = false
- `com.apple.security.device.audio-input` = true

These entitlements are required for Core Audio Taps API on macOS 14.2+.
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Issues**

### User Must Manually Grant Permission

- macOS does **not** automatically prompt for AudioTeeHelper permission
- User must manually add it to Screen Recording permissions
- This is expected behavior for helper apps

### Permission Dialog Name

- Permission appears as "AudioTeeHelper" (not "CueMe Audio Capture Helper")
- This is correct - the app's CFBundleName is "AudioTee Helper"

### No UI Icon

- AudioTeeHelper appears without icon in System Settings
- This is expected - it's a background-only helper (`LSUIElement = true`)
