Diagnostic Plan
Reconfirm Objective: Understand why the shipping build still outputs silent buffers even after v1.0.102 helper signing changes, while npm run dev works. No code changes yet—pure investigation.
Targets & Rationale:
scripts/afterPack.js & scripts/build-helper-app.sh: verify the packaging/signing path you rely on.
Installed helper in /Applications/CueMe.app/.../AudioTeeHelper.app: inspect actual entitlements and signature on the downloaded build.
Runtime logs from the installed app, plus the provided logging.md, to correlate behavior with any entitlement or sandbox issues.
Next Steps
Run codesign -d --entitlements - (and --verbose=4) on the helper inside the installed app to confirm final entitlements and signing identity.
Check the helper binary’s internal signature (codesign -dvvv) and timestamp to see if GitHub Actions/afterPack actually touched it.
Compare helper bundle contents (binary name, Info.plist) between dev build and shipped app to catch mismatches that could invalidate entitlements.
Inspect recent runtime logs from the installed app to see if macOS reports entitlement or TCC denials at launch.
Let me know if you already have any of those artifacts so I don’t duplicate effort. If not, I’ll start executing the commands above to collect data.
