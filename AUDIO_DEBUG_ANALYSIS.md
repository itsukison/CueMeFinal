# Audio Recording Debug Analysis

## Your Question: "Is the race condition the real issue?"

**Answer: NO, you're absolutely right to question it!**

The race condition I fixed would affect **both** development and production equally. Since the app works in development but fails in production, there must be a **production-specific issue**.

## What the Logs Tell Us

From your production logs:
```
‚úÖ Listening started successfully with source: Microphone
(3 seconds of silence - NO audio activity)
üõë Received audio-stream-stop request
```

**What's missing:**
- NO "AudioWorklet log:" messages
- NO "Received audio chunk" messages  
- NO "Sending audio chunk to main process" messages

This means the **AudioWorklet processor is not running at all** in production.

## The Real Issue: AudioWorklet in Production

### Theory 1: AudioWorklet File Not Loading
The AudioWorklet loads from `/audio-worklet-processor.js`. In production:
- File might not be in the correct location
- File might not be accessible due to CSP (Content Security Policy)
- File path might be wrong in packaged app

### Theory 2: AudioWorklet Context Issue
In packaged Electron apps:
- Different security context
- Different file:// protocol handling
- AudioContext might behave differently

### Theory 3: Silent Failure
The AudioWorklet might be:
- Loading successfully but `process()` never called
- Failing silently without throwing an error
- Being blocked by macOS security

## What I Just Added

Enhanced logging to diagnose the exact failure point:

1. **Before AudioWorklet load:**
   ```
   Loading AudioWorklet module from /audio-worklet-processor.js
   ```

2. **After successful load:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ AudioWorklet module loaded successfully
   ‚úÖ AudioWorkletNode created successfully
   ```

3. **If it fails:**
   ```
   ‚ùå AudioWorklet failed: [error message]
   Falling back to ScriptProcessor
   ```

## Next Steps

### Test with New Logging:

```bash
cd CueMeFinal
npm run build
npm run app:build:mac

# Clear logs
> ~/Library/Logs/CueMe/main.log

# Run app
open release/mac/CueMe.app

# Watch logs
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/CueMe/main.log

# Click record and look for:
```

**Scenario A: AudioWorklet Loads**
```
Loading AudioWorklet module...
‚úÖ AudioWorklet module loaded successfully
‚úÖ AudioWorkletNode created successfully
AudioWorklet connected to source and destination
AudioWorklet setup completed
```
‚Üí If you see this but still no chunks, the issue is in the processor itself

**Scenario B: AudioWorklet Fails**
```
Loading AudioWorklet module...
‚ùå AudioWorklet failed: [ERROR MESSAGE HERE]
Falling back to ScriptProcessor
‚úÖ ScriptProcessor created successfully
```
‚Üí The error message will tell us exactly what's wrong

**Scenario C: ScriptProcessor Works**
If ScriptProcessor fallback works and you see audio chunks, then:
- AudioWorklet has a production-specific issue
- We can use ScriptProcessor as the solution

## Possible Solutions

### If AudioWorklet file not found:
- Check if file is copied to packaged app
- Update file path for production
- Add to electron-builder files config

### If AudioWorklet blocked by security:
- Add CSP headers
- Use ScriptProcessor instead (deprecated but works)
- Load AudioWorklet from different location

### If AudioContext issue:
- Try different AudioContext options
- Check if sample rate is supported
- Test with different buffer sizes

## The Race Condition Fix

I still fixed the race condition because:
1. It's a real bug (even if not THE bug)
2. It will prevent future issues
3. It's good defensive programming

But you're right - it's not the root cause of the dev vs production difference.
